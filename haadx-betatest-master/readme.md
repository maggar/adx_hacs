# Home Assistant IHC Beta testing

This is a Home Assistant Custom integration for beta testing the Azure Data Explorer integration.
I will used this when making some bigger changes to the Azure Data Exploerer integration in Home Assisant for beta testing before the code is commited to the main Home Assistant.
This makes it easier for you to do testing, and it also makes it easier and faster to do changes without having to wait for a PR in home assistant.

## Installing

Intall using [hacs](https://hacs.xyz/).
Add a custom repository to hacs (using the github url of this repository).

Alternatively you can copy the custom_components/azure_data_explorer folder manually to your Home Assistant configuration folder.

## Reporting bugs

If you find any bugs/problems use the issues here in github to report your findings.

## Current state

Currently the beta testing has these changes:

* Initial test
